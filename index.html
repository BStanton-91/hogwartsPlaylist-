                As a Gryffindor, You needed to a lot of pump-up songs. These songs could be in a workout or dance party
                playlist depending on your mood.
                Gryffindors are know for being brave, friendly, daring, loyal, playful, and passionate—and depending on
                the day these could be good or bad for others around.
                Thus my fellow Gryffindors and I can always jam to a good beat and lyrics about adventure, fun, and
                living in the present.
                This playlist is dedicated to the Gryffindor who needs some serious pump-up music to revel in their
                greatness. A little healthy pride never hurt anyone, right? </p>
